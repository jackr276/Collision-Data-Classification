# NYC Car Crash Injury Classification
Author: [Jack Robbins](https://www.github.com/jackr276)

## Introduction
This project uses car crash data from the NYC Open Data Portal and various machine learning techniques to clean and analyze the data and create two different classification models(Random Forest and KNN) in an attempt to predict the total number of injuries in a crash. There is a full video overview below, and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/jackr276/Collision-Data-Classification/blob/main/Motor%20Vehicle%20Collisions.ipynb).
